# About

The code is a simple simulation game that allows users to manage resources like money, food, objects, eggs, and meat using the Ursina library. It imports libraries, sets up the environment, defines functions for updating resource counts, creates entities for game elements like the board, resources, shop, storage, and incubator, defines classes for shop products, shop itself, storage, and incubator, implements functionality for buying items, managing storage, and incubating eggs, and sets up the main loop for running the game.

# Features

The Ursina library is a Python-powered game engine that allows for the creation of interactive 2D and 3D games. It is built entirely in Python, making it easy to write concise code without excessive boilerplate. Ursina leverages the Panda3D library for rendering and game development. It provides a flexible environment for managing resources such as money, food, objects, eggs, and meat within your simulation game. Game elements are represented as entities, with each entity having various components such as models, colliders, and animations.

Classes and object-oriented design are available for different game features, such as shop products, shop, storage, and incubator. Dynamic behavior is implemented for purchasing items, managing storage, incubating eggs, and setting up the main loop. Modern UI and customization are possible, with customizable buttons, labels, and other UI components.

Ursina is cross-platform compatible, supporting Windows, Linux, and potentially macOS, allowing developers to develop their game on one platform and run it seamlessly on others. It is free, open source, and licensed under the permissive MIT license, allowing users to modify the source code, fix bugs, and add features as needed.

# Rating

The code provides a functional simulation of a virtual shop and storage system using the Ursina game engine, offering features such as purchasing items, inventory display, and managing storage capacity. It is modular, with distinct classes for different components, enhancing readability and maintainability. The code captures user input through mouse clicks and updates the display based on user actions. Simulation elements include inventory management, resource accumulation, and storage capacity, providing a realistic experience.
However, the code relies heavily on global variables, which can lead to issues with maintainability and readability. There is also some code redundancy, particularly in the creation of shop products and handling input events. Consolidating repetitive code into functions or methods could reduce redundancy and improve code maintainability. The GUI design is simplistic and lacks visual appeal, which could be improved by adding graphical elements, animations, or visual feedback.
Error handling is not included in the code, which could be improved by reducing global variables, refactoring redundant code, enhancing the GUI design, and implementing robust error handling mechanisms. These improvements aim to improve the reliability and stability of the application and make the simulation more engaging and engaging for users.
