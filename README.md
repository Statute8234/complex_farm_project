## About

The code is a simple simulation game that allows users to manage resources like money, food, objects, eggs, and meat using the Ursina library. It imports libraries, sets up the environment, defines functions for updating resource counts, creates entities for game elements like the board, resources, shop, storage, and incubator, defines classes for shop products, shop itself, storage, and incubator, implements functionality for buying items, managing storage, and incubating eggs, and sets up the main loop for running the game.

## Imports

random, ursina 

# Ratting

The code is well-structured and organized, making it a solid foundation for a resource management simulation game, but there's room for improvement in readability, comments, and performance optimization in certain parts.
